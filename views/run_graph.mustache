        <div>
            <p>
                "Rapid sensemaking" in the context of the "rapid sensemaking framework" (rsf) means using digital tools
                to quickly and easily reach many people across many mediums, from Telegram to text messaging and far
                further, and to engage them in processes of ideation, decision making, voting, or other social
                thinking/acting.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can read more about it here: <a target="_blank"

            </p>
            <p>
                There are THREE stages to this particular process, the Ideation stage, Reaction stage, and the Summary
                stage.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The IDEATION stage can be used for generating one or more responses to any prompt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The REACTION stage can be used for determining reactions (feelings) about the responses from
                    IDEATION stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The SUMMARY stage is to send the full list of results to someone(s).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As soon as you finish filling in this form, the rsf process will commence, meaning messages will
                immediately be sent to the participants you listed during configuration.
            </p>
